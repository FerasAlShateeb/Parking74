# Getting Started

**Make Sure to use "2022.3.20f1" Unity Editor Version for Developement**
- This to make sure the building/running the project is done with the minimal time.
- Using a different version will not probably  result in errors or unexpected behavior during development process. However, it will make openning the project faster.
